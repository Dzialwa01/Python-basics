# Strings in python

# To declare a string, you can either "" or ''

# If there is a situation where you need to use the single quote in a string i.e. contraction
# You can use backslash, \, to escape the single quote or use double quotes

#e.g.
print('AI says, I\'m here to assist you.')
print("AI says, I'm here to assist you.")

# To create a multiline string, use write the output within 3 quotes
ai_response = """Hello there!
I'm an AI here to help.
Feel free to ask me anything.
"""
print(ai_response)

#We can achieve the same thing by using \n
ai_prompt = 'Welcome to AI Bot\nYour virtual assistant\nHere to assist with all things tech!'
print(ai_prompt)

#Special Characters and escape sequences
#- '\' is a special character for escape sequences
## \n (new line), \t(tab),
